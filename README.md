# RYST
RYST coding challenge for Overture

## Overview

This project took in total 7 hours to complete (5.5 - 6 hours of coding and 1 - 1.5 hours of design) 
It utilizes the RYSTAPIs which are documented here:
- [RYST APIs](https://gist.github.com/alloy-d/29cb57765ace223d6350) (APIs for storing and accessing RYST videos)

Clearly I am not a designer/UX specialist and so I did the best with my limited adobe abilities but I think it turned out well, hope you enjoy and thanks for the opportunity!
